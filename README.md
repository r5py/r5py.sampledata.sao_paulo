# TEMPLATE for r5py sample data sets

This is a template repository for creating new r5py sample data sets. R5py
sample data sets are [namespace
packages](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/#native-namespace-packages)
underneath the namespace `r5py.sampledata`.

To create a new sample data set, 
    - create a repository from this template, and adjust `pyproject.toml` (look
      out for ‘CHANGE_THIS’, and also 
    - adapt the list of authors accordingly. Then,
    - rename the directory `src/r5py/sampledata/CHANGE_THIS` to a *lowercase*
      name reflecting the content of the sample data set (e.g., the name of the
      city it covers). 
    - Add the sample files to `data/`,
    - and edit `src/r5py/sampledata/NOW_CHANGED_DIRECTORY_NAME/__init__.py`: 
        - change `BASE_URL`, and
        - include one variable per data set that is an
          `r5py.util.data_set.DataSet()` with the source url and the SHA256
          checksum as parameters, and
        - add the data set variable to `__all__`. Then,
        - update the `__version__` string, and
    - edit this README to tell about the data set. Also, don’t forget to
    - change `CHANGE_THIS` in `tests/test_data_sets.py`.

Once you have added all data sets, add a tag (equal to `f"v{__version__}`) and
push the changes and tags.
